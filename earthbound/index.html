			The year is 20XX. It's been years since GIYGAS attacked and the world has seemed quiet since.
			Haunting memories taunt the young boy from Onett but can he learn to conquer them or will his
			own mind be his own downfall. Lost and alone in a world he doesn't recognize. Welcome to the 
			DEPTHS.

			<h1>EarthBound: DEPTHS</h1>
			<span class="info-text">
			DEPTHS is a look into the mind of people suffering from
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder" target="_blank">PTSD</a>
			and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia" target="_blank">Schizophrenia</a>.
			Because of these reasons this game will not be for the faint of heart and if you are sensetive
			to adult materials such as <span class="highlight">gore, drug use, domestic violence and 
			sexual innuendo then this game is not for you.</span>
