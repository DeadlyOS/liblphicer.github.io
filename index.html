			You wanna donate? Yeah that pretty cool. It goes to a few things and even gets you a schwifty role on our
			discord server and some other perks I haven't quite figured out yet... Maybe being featured in an upcoming
			video? Yeah I'll think of something. If you want you can donate using the button bellow.
