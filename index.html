			Project: SCAMB8 (pronounced "Scambait"), is a project started by Liblphicer after receiving inspiration by

			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQrAHGpBz3PqBV4-_9PdDcA" target="_blank">Each&Everything</a>.
			The objective is to annoy and waste as much time of Fake Microsoft Scammers and others so they don't have
			time to scam other innocent people.
